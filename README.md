# Setup Scala Environment
The video demonstration follows the steps to install Scala, SBT and JDK in the development environment. It also covers the steps to install and setup a suitable IntelliJ IDE. I have tweaked the steps to containarize the development environement. Steps are mentioned as below:

1. Run Git bash    
```   
$ pwd  
/c/Users/swati/Box Sync/Independent Study/SpecialTopics/summer2019_swati_scalasparkpythonkafka
$ touch Dockerfile
#Dockerfile contains the image installation for Scala-SBT-JDK
```
